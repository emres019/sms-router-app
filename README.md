# sms-router-app
A toy application to send filtered sms content to another person.

<h1>Reads SMS Coming From The Sender</h1>
It only reads messages from the sender and never saves message content. You can trust it!

<h1>Doesn't Drain Battery</h1>
It doesn't run in the background. When an SMS message arrives, the android system will wake it up. It consumes almost nothing.
