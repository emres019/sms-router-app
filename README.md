# SMS Router
A toy application to send filtered sms content to another person.

## Reads SMS Coming From The Sender
It only reads messages from the sender and never saves message content. You can trust it!

## Doesn't Drain Battery
It doesn't run in the background. When an SMS message arrives, the android system will wake it up. It consumes almost nothing.
